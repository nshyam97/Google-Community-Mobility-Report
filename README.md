# Google Community Mobility Report

This repository contains a notebook going through the analysis I have done using the Google Community Mobility Data provided [here](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/). As the notebook uses plotly plots that aren't shown within GitHub's static view of notebooks, you can access the full notebook online using https://nbviewer.jupyter.org.

This [link](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nshyam97/Google-Community-Mobility-Report/blob/master/report.ipynb) should take you straight to this notebook on nbviewer however, this is subject to change and I cannot guarantee that this link will work forever.
